A FINGERPRINT ENABLED PAYMENT SYSTEM ON BLOCKCHAIN
# Securing AEPS through Blockchain Technology

- AEPS(Aadhaar Enabled Payment System) is a revolutionary technology that 
has the potential to transform financial inclusion in India. This presentation 
explores the benefits of integrating blockchain technology with AEPS to 
enhance security, transparency, and efficiency in the financial ecosystem.

- AEPS is a biometric-based payment system that allows individuals to access 
their bank accounts, make transactions, and withdraw cash using their 
Aadhaar number and fingerprint authentication. With over 1.2 billion Aadhaar 
enrollments, AEPS has the potential to reach the unbanked population and 
provide them with easy access to financial services.

## Problems with Aeps and their solution using Blockchain

- Several frauds are led out across the country using the fingerprints collected. Such frauds, Man in the Middle attacks, all this could be easily handled by securing the transactions using Blockchain.

- The transactions would be secured since just getting  the fingerprints would not help the attackers. They would require a private key along with the fingerprints to carryout the frauds.

- The hash of the fingerprint data would be used for the transactions, so even if there is slightest of chance of Man in the Middle attack, and the attacker getting the hash but there is no chance of getting the original data since hash is irreversible.
